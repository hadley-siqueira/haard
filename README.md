# The Haard Programming Language

Haard is a programming language with syntax inspired 
mainly from Python, but the semantics are more similar to C++. 

This repository contains the source code for the first compiler
of the language, which is being implemented in C++. It is still in
development and can't produce a 'hello, world' yet.

## Install from source

You need cmake to compile the project. The project uses only plain C++11, so
you don't need to worry about dependencies :)

1. Clone the repository
2. Enter the directory
3. Create a folder named build and enter it
4. Run cmake
5. Run makefile
6. There will be a binary named hdc in the build folder

```
git clone https://github.com/hadley-siqueira/haard.git
cd haard
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## The language

The programming language is named Haard. The name is a play of the 
word 'hard' because one of the goals of the language is to be able to do
system development (hard -> hardware -> operating system). Also, I wanted 
to try to do some fun by saying that 'haard is not hard :)'.

Haard is a compiled language and it will try to provide the following:

* Type inference
* Templates
* Classes
* Closures and/or lambdas
* A nice standard library
* Low-level access (for system development such as operating systems)
* Other stuff that I don't remeber right now

Below are some examples of the language syntax. The syntax is inpired mostly on 
Python, but Ruby, VHDL, C++, Java, Rust and others are used also as inspiration. 
Although the syntax is Python-like, the semantics are more similar to the ones of
C and C++.

You may wonder why I am creating this language. There are some reasons:

1. I've always wanted to learn how compilers work on detail and I believe this project
  can help me on this.
2. I like to work with homemade softcore processors in FPGA and with this project I aim to have
  a compiler that I can modify to my will
3. LLVM is a great project but using it would be against the objectives of item 1 of this list
4. I like to program in low-level but also like high-level stuff. I missed features in C in C++ that were
   present in other languages but not in C and C++. E.g.: 
    * use a simple import/use instead of include+ifdef. 
    * do not worry about recursive file inclusions
    * type inference without being verbose (no need to auto keyword and similar stuff)
    * closures
    * a nice standard library without having to resort to boost with verbose syntax

There are other reasons but I guess I don't need to explain all of them right now.

### A simple 'Hello, world'

```python
import std.io

def main : void
    println('hello, world!')
```

### A simple sum function

A function to add two numbers. Note that parameters are declared one per line. The syntax here
was inspired by VHDL where it is common to declare one input/output per line. The @ precedes the
parameter's name and then there is the type of the parameter. Comments uses # and function calls
syntax is similar to other languages

```python
# a function that returns an int
import std.io

def sum : int 
    @a : int
    @b : int

    return a + b

def main : int
    a = 2
    b = 5

    println('The sum is ' + sum(a, b))
    return 0
```

#### What about those @?

I care about presentation. Did you already came by a C++/Java/Alike code such as:

```C
GArray*
g_array_sized_new (gboolean zero_terminated,
                   gboolean clear,
                   guint    elt_size,
                   guint    reserved_size)
{
```

The example is from glib. Do you see how there is one parameter per line? Well, its awkward
to me to see a '(' on one line and then '{' on next line. So I decided to use:

```python
def g_array_sized_new : GArray*
    @zero_terminated : gboolean
    @clear           : gboolean
    @elt_size        : guint
    @reserved_size   : guint
```

### Control flow

A sample program that shows some control flow

```python
import std.io

def main : void
    i = 0

    while i < 10:
        println(i)
        ++i

    for i = 0; i < 10; ++i:
        println(i)

    for i in 0 .. 10:
        println(i)

    for i in range(0, 10):
        if i > 5:
            println('i is greater than 5')
        else:
            if i == 0:
                println('i = 0')
            elif i == 1:
                println('i = 1')
            else:
                println('i <= 5')
```

### Pointers

As I said, Haard has semantics similar to C and C++ and it also has pointers.

```python
import std.io

def main : int
    @args : String[]

    println('Running program ' + args[0] + '...\n')
    size = int(input('Enter the size: '))

    v = new int[size]

    for i in 0 .. size:
        v[i] = int(input('Enter a number: '))

    print('v = {')

    for i in 0 .. size - 1:
        println('' + v[i] + ', ')

    # its just a demo. Don't blame me for invalid memory access
    println('' + v[size - 1] + '}')

    delete[] v
    *(v + 2) = *v # uh oh, maybe a segfault here
```

Function with pointer parameters:

```python
# a simple struct
struct Pixel:
    r : u8 # u8 is equivalent to uint8_t
    g : u8
    b : u8

def negative : void
    @pixel : Pixel*

    pixel->r = 255 - pixel->r 
    pixel->g = 255 - pixel->g

    # can also use . instead of ->
    # Compiler is smart enough to handle this case so you can always type .
    # so you don't have to worry about pointer, reference, value etc
    pixel.b = 255 - pixel.b

def strlen : uint
    @s : char*

    counter = 0

    while *s != '\0':
        ++s
        ++counter

    return counter

# template here
def swap<T> : void
    @p1 : T*
    @p2 : T*

    tmp = *p1
    *p1 = *p2
    *p2 = tmp

def create_matrix : int**
    @n : int
    @m : int

    v = new int*[n]

    for i in 0 .. n:
        v[i] = new int[m]

    return v

def main : void
    p = 'hello'
    strlen(p)

    a = 2
    b = 3
    swap<int>(&a, &b)

    matrix = create_matrix(10, 20)

    pixel = Pixel()

    pixel.r = 0
    pixel.g = 0
    pixel.b = 0

    negative(&pixel)
```

### String interpolation

We intend to support string interpolation. Some examples

```python
def main : void
    a = 2
    b = 5
    c = "a + b = ${a + b}"
    d = "a = $a and b = $b"

```

### Classes

A simple Player class

```python
import game.field.position

class Player:
    life : int # class variables
    x    : int
    y    : int

    # constructor
    def init : void
        @life : int
        @x    : int
        @y    : int

        this.life = life
        this.x = x
        this.y = y

    def is_alive : bool
        return life > 0 

    def get_position : Position
        return Position(x, y)
```

A generic binary tree:

```python
class Node<T>:
    elem  : T
    left  : Node<T>*
    right : Node<T>*

    # methods come here

class Tree<T>:
    root : Node<T>*

    # methods come here
```

### Enumerations

```python

# like C 
enum Colors:
    RED
    GREEN
    BLUE

# make each enum be a char size internally
enum Colors(char):
    RED
    GREEN
    BLUE

# It can also have expressions
enum Mask:
    Mask1 = 1 << 0
    Mask2 = 1 << 1
    Mask3 = 1 << 2
    Mask4 = 0b1001

# enums can also behave like algebraic data types (also known as tagged unions)
enum Event:
    None     : void
    Click    : (int, int)
    Keypress : char

# enums can then be pattern matched

# convert an enum to a string
def to_str : str
    @ev : Event&

    switch ev
    case None:
        return "None"

    case Click(x, y):
        return "Click($x, $y)"   # $x and $y are string interpolation

    case Keypress(c):
        return "Keypress($c)"

def main : void
    ev = Click(2, 3) # create an Event
    ev2 = Event.Click(2, 3) # you can also be more precise if you want
    ev3 = None

    println(to_str(ev))
    println(ev2.to_str()) # using method call syntax
    println("ev3 = $ev3") # or using string interpolation

# you can also use templates. The famous Option, Maybe and similar can be
# implemented as

enum Option<T>:
    None : void
    Some : T

    # enums can also have methods
    def unwrap : T&
        switch this
        case None:
            # handle None case. Maybe finish program

        case Some(a):
            return a
```
